  Welcome to Fede-ai's profile

Hi, I'm a 17 yo self taught full stack programmer from Italy. I've been programming since I was 13 and I do it mainly for fun.

Right now, I mostly program in C++, using the SFML library and experimenting with neural networks (built mainly from scratch). I've recently started learning Javascript using React and Electron and that's what I think I will focus on for a while. I'm also planning to learn new languages like Typescript, Phyton or C#.
